It is the government\u2019s claim against all or some of your assets based on your failure to pay a tax debt on time. They may occur at the state or local level, or at the federal level. A tax lien may be imposed for delinquent taxes owed on real property or personal property, or as a result of failure to pay income taxes or other taxes. An IRS tax lien is a legal claim to your property as security or payment for your tax debt. What is a civil judgment? A civil judgment is a ruling against a defendant in a court of law. It can arise from small claims, unpaid debts, property damage as a result of negligence and so forth. Benefits of a tax lien and judgments search As of July 2017, the three major credit bureaus have begun to remove tax liens and judgments from credit reports . Because of that, it is a good idea to perform tax liens and judgments search if you are about to enter into a business venture with someone or if you are hiring someone for a financial position where fiscal responsibility is paramount.

That\u2019s Melissa Tuff\u2019s website. She\u2019s put her life and her plight online trying to raise money for a kidney transplant she can't afford. She hopes her story will move\u00a0someone to\u00a0step forward, and as she said, \u201cgive me their spare.\u201d If Tuff can find a donor to part with one of two healthy kidneys and have it transplanted into her body, she\u2019ll have four. The two she was born with are still in her. They gave out 20 years ago,\u00a0when she was 16 and developed rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, a\u00a0life-threatening kidney disease.\u00a0Within months she was in renal failure. She went on dialysis and on to the transplant list in Michigan, where she was living at the time. Over the next nine years Tuff endured 1,483 hemodialysis treatments. One Thursday night about 10 years ago, she decided to go to a casino. Her luck arrived before she got there. The University of Michigan Transplant Center called. She needed to come in right away. They had a kidney. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m living for both of us.\u201d Tuff said she doesn\u2019t know much about the man who died and whose kidney she received. He was 36 years old, the age Tuff is now. He had a head injury. She wrote a letter to his family but never heard back. \u00a0Within days of getting his kidney she felt great. Better than she had felt in a decade. Dialysis had taken a toll on Tuff. She was diagnosed with an enlarged heart. She lost calcium in her bones. Her muscles deteriorated and she suffered debilitating nausea, vomiting and leg cramps. Dialysis would make her blood pressure drop so low she would lose consciousness. Once she passed out while driving. Fortunately, she was stopped. But her foot came off the brake and she bumped a car in front of her. After that, she couldn\u2019t drive herself to dialysis anymore. Tuff finished schoo",
